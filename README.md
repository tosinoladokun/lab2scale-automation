# Lab2Scale Automation System

A multi-agent platform that monitors deep tech research and events three
times a day across five focus areas and three cities, then emails a weekly
intelligence brief to the team.

- **System 1** — 5 domain agents (power generation, energy storage, power
  electronics, semiconductors, deep tech infrastructure) scoring papers,
  news, and patents.
- **System 2** — 3 city agents (Boston, NYC, SF) tracking conferences,
  seminars, and meetups.
- **System 3** — weekly delivery: queries everything unreported, has Claude
  Sonnet write the executive summary, renders the email, ships via Resend.

All three share one SQLite/Postgres data store, one shared `Scraper`, one
shared `LLMFilter`, and a unified dedup layer (`seen_hashes`).

For the design rationale read **`ARCHITECTURE.md`**; for every knob you can
turn at deploy time read **`context.md`**.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ (3.12 tested)
- An Anthropic API key (Claude Haiku + Sonnet)
- A Resend API key (only required when actually sending email; previews work
  without one)

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/kope-kope/lab2scale-automation.git Automation
cd Automation
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — at minimum set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# For email later: RESEND_API_KEY=re_..., REPORT_RECIPIENT, REPORT_FROM

# 3. Create the database
python main.py init-db

# 4. Run a research sweep (RSS only — cost-safe default ~$0.10–0.50)
python main.py sweep

# 5. Preview the weekly brief — no email is sent, HTML is written to disk
python main.py report --dry-run
open data/latest_report.html       # macOS; xdg-open on Linux
```

---

## Commands

```bash
python main.py init-db                 # Create tables (idempotent)
python main.py sweep                   # System 1 + 2 monitoring sweep
python main.py report [--dry-run]      # System 3 weekly brief
python main.py full [--dry-run]        # Sweep, then report
```

`--dry-run` on `report`/`full` writes the rendered HTML to
`data/latest_report.html` instead of calling Resend. It still marks the
included items as reported — preview = published, from the system's POV.

### Environment toggles

| Variable | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `SWEEP_METHODS` | `rss`, `scrape`, or `rss,scrape` | `rss` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:///...` or `postgresql://...` | `sqlite:///data/lab2scale.db` |
| `LLM_SCORING_MODEL` | Haiku model for scoring + extraction | `claude-haiku-4-5` |
| `LLM_SUMMARY_MODEL` | Sonnet model for the weekly summary | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| `REPORT_RECIPIENT` | Where the brief goes (primary `to`) | `team@lab-2-scale.com` |
| `REPORT_CC` | Extra CC recipients, comma/semicolon list — change anytime, no redeploy | _(none)_ |
| `REPORT_FROM` | Verified Resend sender | `reports@lab-2-scale.com` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Standard Python log level | `INFO` |

Full reference, including code-level defaults and a test-vs-live config
sheet, lives in **`context.md`**.

## Cost discipline

- **`SWEEP_METHODS=rss`** is the cost-safe default — fetches the ~85 RSS
  sources, drops anything older than the rolling window before any LLM
  call.
- **`SWEEP_METHODS=rss,scrape`** unlocks the ~200 `web_scrape` sources;
  roughly doubles per-sweep cost on the first run, near-zero thereafter
  (dedup).
- Dedup via `seen_hashes` means re-running `sweep` minutes apart costs
  essentially nothing.

Rough numbers:
- One full RSS sweep: ~$0.30–1.50 (scales with how many items are inside
  the date window).
- One weekly Sonnet summary: ~$0.02–0.05.
- Empty-week heartbeat brief: $0 (no Sonnet call).

---

## Schedule (production)

Per `ARCHITECTURE.md`:

```
Daily 06:00 / 13:00 / 20:00 ET  →  python main.py sweep
Monday 09:00 ET                 →  python main.py report
```

Translation to UTC for cron: `0 11,18,1 * * *` (sweep) and `0 14 * * 1`
(report).

---

## Testing

```bash
pytest tests/                 # offline, no API keys required
pytest tests/ -q --tb=short   # quiet
```

Each module has unit tests; orchestrator-level tests use fake scrapers and
fake LLMs against an in-memory SQLite. Live verification scripts live in
`scripts/try_*.py` (gitignored).

### Email render verification across clients

Before a real send, preview the rendered email with representative data:

```bash
# Seeds the DB with diverse mock findings + events, then dry-runs the report.
python scripts/try_seed.py
open data/latest_report.html
```

To verify rendering across actual mail clients:

1. Open `data/latest_report.html` in Chrome / Safari / Firefox
2. Save the page or copy the HTML and email it to test inboxes (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)
3. For a comprehensive check, paste the HTML into [Litmus](https://litmus.com) or [Email on Acid](https://www.emailonacid.com)

The template uses table-based layout with inline CSS and stays under 600px,
which is the broadly-compatible pattern.

## Deployment — GitHub Actions (free)

The weekly brief runs as a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow —
[`.github/workflows/weekly-brief.yml`](.github/workflows/weekly-brief.yml).
No external host, no bill: a weekly ~2-minute run uses a handful of the
2,000 free Actions minutes/month.

**Dedup state persists across runs.** The runner itself is ephemeral, but
the SQLite dedup DB (`data/lab2scale.db`) is carried between weeks on a
dedicated, single-commit, force-pushed `state` branch — restored before the
run, pushed back after a successful send. This matters because the research
**web-search path looks back 30 days** (`RESEARCH_SEARCH_DAYS`), so
consecutive weekly runs overlap; without the carried-over DB the brief would
re-report the same companies for weeks. A failed run is *not* persisted, so a
mid-run failure simply re-sweeps cleanly next time rather than inheriting a
half-updated "reported" state. The DB never touches `main`.

### One-time setup

1. **Add the secrets.** Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions →
   *New repository secret*, one per line below. Required for the full run are
   the first three; the rest enable optional features (they self-disable when
   unset). See `context.md` for the full reference.
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY      # required — LLM scoring / extraction / summary
   TAVILY_API_KEY         # required — research + event discovery
   RESEND_API_KEY         # required — sending the brief
   REPORT_RECIPIENT       # optional — who receives it
   REPORT_FROM            # optional — From address
   REPORT_CC              # optional — extra CC recipients
   LEADS_WEBAPP_URL       # optional — Apps Script leads sheet
   LEADS_WEBAPP_SECRET    # optional — shared secret for the above
   ```
   Non-secret research tuning (`RESEARCH_WINDOW_DAYS`, `RESEARCH_SEARCH_THRESHOLD`,
   `RESEARCH_SEARCH_DAYS`) lives as plain `env:` in the workflow — edit it there.

2. **Confirm the schedule.** The workflow declares one weekly cron — Monday
   16:00 UTC (9am PT) running `python main.py full` (sweep + report in one
   shot). To adjust, edit the `cron:` line under `on.schedule`. Note GitHub
   cron is fixed-UTC and can't follow DST (`0 17 * * 1` holds 9am through
   winter); for daily cadence use `0 16 * * *` and set `RESEARCH_WINDOW_DAYS`
   to `"1"`.

3. **That's it — no deploy step.** Actions always runs the workflow as it
   exists on the default branch; merging to `main` is the whole "deploy".

### Running it on demand

The workflow has a `workflow_dispatch` trigger: Actions tab → *Weekly
intelligence brief* → *Run workflow*. Tick **dry_run** to render the email to
an artifact (`latest_report`) without sending or touching dedup state —
handy for previewing template changes.

### Verifying the first run

- The first Monday after setup, Actions triggers the cron at 16:00 UTC.
- Logs live under the repo's **Actions** tab, per run.
- The email lands in `REPORT_RECIPIENT`'s inbox.
- After the first real run a `state` branch appears holding `lab2scale.db`;
  subsequent runs restore and update it.

### Future: 3×-daily sweeps (not currently planned)

The original architecture imagined 3×-daily sweeps accumulating into a
single weekly report. The persistent `state` branch already removes the main
blocker (cross-run state), so bringing it back is now mostly a scheduling
change: add a second workflow (or cron entry) running `python main.py sweep`
3× daily, and leave the weekly job to run `report`. For heavier concurrency
you'd graduate the DB from SQLite to Postgres (swap `aiosqlite` for an
`asyncpg` driver in `lib/data_store.py`).

### Cron timezone reference

```
Sweep (3×/day):    0 11,18,1 * * *   UTC   = 6am, 1pm, 8pm ET
Report (weekly):   0 14 * * 1         UTC   = 9am ET Monday
Full (weekly):     0 14 * * 1         UTC   = 9am ET Monday  ← current default
```

### Local testing of the image

```bash
docker build -t lab2scale-automation .
docker run --rm --env-file .env -v "$(pwd)/data:/app/data" \
  lab2scale-automation python main.py full --dry-run
```

### Helper scripts

`scripts/setup.sh` — one-shot local setup (venv, install, init-db).
`scripts/run_sweep.sh` — wrapper for local cron / systemd / manual.
`scripts/run_report.sh` — same, passes args through (e.g. `--dry-run`).
